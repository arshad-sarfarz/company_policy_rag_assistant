## **1. Purpose and Objectives**

The purpose of this policy is to establish a transparent and consistent process for managing all business-related travel and expense reimbursements.
The company recognizes that employees occasionally incur expenses necessary for conducting business activities—such as client meetings, training programs, or conferences.

This policy ensures that such expenditures are:

* **Reasonable:** Expenses should align with business necessity and cost-efficiency.
* **Reimbursable:** Legitimate out-of-pocket expenses are reimbursed promptly.
* **Controlled:** Proper approval, documentation, and audit practices prevent misuse.

By following this policy, employees can travel confidently while maintaining accountability and financial integrity.

## **2. Scope**

This policy applies to all full-time, part-time, and contract employees incurring company-related travel or business expenses.
It covers all forms of travel (air, rail, car, lodging), meals, local transportation, communication costs, and related expenditures.

Expenses incurred for personal reasons or not pre-approved are not reimbursable.
