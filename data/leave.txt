================================================================================
1. POLICY OVERVIEW AND PHILOSOPHY
================================================================================

At TechCorp Solutions, we believe that time away from work is essential for maintaining physical health, mental wellbeing, and work-life balance. This policy outlines the various types of leave available to our employees and the procedures for requesting and using time off.

Our Guiding Principles:
- Employees should use their allotted time off to rest and recharge
- Taking time off is encouraged and supported by management
- Adequate advance notice allows for proper coverage and planning
- All leave requests are treated fairly and consistently
- We trust employees to use leave responsibly and honestly

This policy applies to all regular full-time and part-time employees of TechCorp Solutions. Temporary, contract, and intern positions have separate leave arrangements detailed in their employment agreements.

================================================================================
2. PAID TIME OFF (PTO)
================================================================================

2.1 PTO PHILOSOPHY

TechCorp uses a combined PTO approach where vacation, personal days, and short-term illness are drawn from a single PTO bank. This provides flexibility for employees to use their time off as needed without categorizing each absence.

2.2 PTO ACCRUAL RATES

Full-Time Employees (40 hours/week):

Years of Service | Annual PTO Days | Per Pay Period Accrual
0-2 years        | 15 days (120 hrs) | 4.62 hours
3-5 years        | 20 days (160 hrs) | 6.15 hours
6-10 years       | 25 days (200 hrs) | 7.69 hours
11+ years        | 30 days (240 hrs) | 9.23 hours

Part-Time Employees:
PTO is prorated based on scheduled hours. For example, an employee working 20 hours/week receives 50% of the full-time PTO allotment.

2.3 PTO ACCRUAL DETAILS

- PTO begins accruing from your first day of employment
- Accruals are calculated per pay period (bi-weekly)
- You can use PTO after completing 90 days of employment
- PTO accrued during the first 90 days becomes available on day 91
- Unused PTO rolls over annually up to a maximum cap

2.4 PTO MAXIMUM CAPS

To encourage regular time off usage, we cap PTO accumulation:

- 0-2 years service: Maximum 180 hours (22.5 days)
- 3-5 years service: Maximum 240 hours (30 days)
- 6-10 years service: Maximum 300 hours (37.5 days)
- 11+ years service: Maximum 360 hours (45 days)

Once you reach your cap, you stop accruing PTO until you use some time off. You will receive a notification when you reach 80% of your cap.

2.5 PTO USAGE GUIDELINES

Minimum Increment: PTO can be used in 4-hour increments (half-day) or greater.

Advance Notice Requirements:
- 1-3 days off: Request at least 1 week in advance
- 4-7 days off: Request at least 2 weeks in advance
- 8+ days off: Request at least 4 weeks in advance
- Last-minute illness: Notify manager as soon as possible, no later than 1 hour after shift start

Blackout Periods:
Certain departments may have blackout periods during critical business times. Your manager will communicate these at least 60 days in advance. Examples:
- Finance: Month-end close periods
- Retail: Holiday shopping season
- Tax: January-April 15
- Software: Major release weeks

2.6 PTO SCHEDULING AND APPROVAL

Requesting PTO:
1. Check team calendar for existing PTO and coverage
2. Discuss with your manager informally if unsure about timing
3. Submit formal request in BambooHR at least by minimum notice period
4. Manager will approve or deny within 3 business days
5. Add approved PTO to team calendar

Managers will consider:
- Adequate advance notice
- Business needs and coverage requirements
- Previous commitments and deadlines
- Other team members' scheduled PTO
- First-come, first-served when possible

Denial Reasons:
PTO may be denied if:
- Insufficient advance notice (except emergencies)
- Inadequate coverage for critical functions
- During blackout periods
- Too many team members off simultaneously
- Critical project deadlines or client commitments

If denied, your manager must provide reason and work with you to find alternative dates.

2.7 PTO DURING HOLIDAYS

When a company holiday falls during your PTO:
- You are NOT charged PTO for the holiday
- Example: You take PTO Monday-Friday, and Monday is a company holiday. You are only charged for Tuesday-Friday (4 days, not 5 days)

2.8 PTO PAYOUT PROVISIONS

During Employment:

================================================================================
12. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: Can I take PTO during my first 90 days?
A: PTO accrues from day one, but cannot be used until after 90 days of employment. All accrued PTO becomes available on day 91.

Q: What happens to unused PTO at year-end?
A: PTO rolls over to the next year up to the maximum cap for your service level. Once you hit the cap, you stop accruing until you use some PTO.

Q: Can I donate PTO to a coworker in need?
A: Currently, TechCorp does not have a PTO donation program, but we are exploring this option for future implementation.

Q: What if I'm sick and out of PTO?
A: Contact HR to discuss options, which may include short-term unpaid leave or advancing future PTO accruals in extreme circumstances.

Q: Can I take PTO in half-day increments?
A: Yes, minimum increment is 4 hours (half-day). You can take morning off (4 hours) or afternoon off (4 hours).

Q: Do I have to take PTO for doctor appointments?
A: Yes, appointments during work hours require using PTO. However, we encourage flexible scheduling (come in early, stay late) to minimize PTO usage for short appointments.

Q: What if a family member has a serious health condition requiring ongoing care?
A: This may qualify for FMLA intermittent leave. Contact HR to discuss your situation and available options.

Q: Can I work remotely instead of using PTO for a minor illness?
A: If you're well enough to work productively and your role allows remote work, discuss with your manager. However, prioritize your health and recovery.

Q: What if I need time off for religious observances not covered by floating holidays?
A: You can use floating holidays or PTO for religious observances. If you need additional time, discuss with your manager and HR for possible accommodation.

Q: Can I schedule PTO during my notice period if I'm resigning?
A: Generally no. Notice period is for transition and knowledge transfer. Exceptions rare and require VP approval.

Q: What if my manager denies my PTO request?
A: Your manager should provide a reason and work with you to find alternative dates. If you feel the denial is unfair, you can escalate to HR or your manager's supervisor.

Q: How is PTO calculated if I'm promoted or change to/from part-time?
A: PTO accrual rate adjusts effective the date of your status change. If moving from part-time to full-time, your accrual rate increases going forward. Existing PTO balance remains unchanged.

Q: Can I use PTO while on leave of absence?
A: No, PTO and unpaid leave are separate. You must exhaust PTO before starting unpaid leave (except for specific circumstances like FMLA).

Q: What if I want to take extended time off (more than 2 weeks)?
A: Discuss with your manager well in advance (2-3 months minimum). Depending on duration, this may require unpaid leave in addition to PTO. Sabbatical may be option if eligible.

Q: Do contractors or temporary employees get PTO?
A: No, PTO is for regular full-time and part-time employees only. Contract terms specify any time-off arrangements.
